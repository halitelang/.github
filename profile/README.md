# Halite

Halite is a general-purpose programming language designed with simplicity, readability, and performance in mind. It supports procedural programming paradigm along with prototypal inheritance, allowing developers to write efficient and readable code. Halite is strongly typed with optional type inference, ensuring robustness while easing the development process.

## Features

- Procedural paradigm with prototypal inheritance
- Minimalist and readable syntax
- Strong static type system with optional type inference
- Garbage collection
- Support for parallelism using fibers
- Extensive but modular standard library
- Debugging and profiling tools
- Multiple build systems support
- Transpilation capability
- Standalone executables

## File Extension

Halite source files have a `.hal` extension.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - the all-in-one JavaScript runtime which is needed for halc, the halite compiler

### Compilation

HALC IS NOT YET COMPLETED!! THIS WILL NOT WORK!

Halite is compiled using the Bun runtime. To compile a Halite program, use the following command:

```bash
bun run compile ./<file>.hal
```

Replace `<file>` with the name of your Halite source file.
